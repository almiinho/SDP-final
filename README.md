Name of your final project: Media Player Application


Group: SE-2215


Team members: Azamatov Almaz



Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a versatile media player application capable of handling various types of media, including audio  files. The media player will provide essential playback functionalities, support for different media formats, and a user-friendly interface.
The primary purpose of this media player application is to offer users a seamless and enjoyable experience while managing and playing their media files. The application will be designed to enhance user convenience, allowing them to organize, play, and customize their media playback according to their preferences.




Objectives of the Work:

Multimedia Support:
Develop a media player that supports a wide range of audio and video formats to ensure compatibility with various media files.



User-Friendly Interface:
Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate, organize, and play their media content.



Customization Options:
Incorporate customization options, allowing users to apply themes, shuffle playback, and personalize their media player experience.


Observer Pattern:
Implement the observer pattern to notify users about the currently playing media item, enhancing the user experience with real-time updates.






Main body:



Multimedia Support:

Explanation: The media player should be capable of handling various audio and video formats such as MP3, WAV, MP4, etc.


User-Friendly Interface:

Explanation: The user interface is designed for ease of use, featuring intuitive controls for media playback, volume adjustment, and playlist management.


Customization Options:

Explanation: Users can customize the media player by applying themes, enabling shuffle playback, and adjusting other settings according to their preferences.


Observer Pattern:The observer pattern is implemented to notify users in real-time about the currently playing media item. This enhances the user experience with immediate updates.


Singleton Pattern: Ensures a single instance of the media player, preventing unnecessary instantiation.



Strategy Pattern: Provides different playback strategies (e.g., normal playback, shuffle playback) that can be switched dynamically.



Decorator Pattern: Allows users to apply visual themes as decorators to the media player, enhancing its appearance.



Factory Pattern: Creates different types of media items (audio, video) using a factory, promoting flexibility in adding new media types.




Conclusion:



Key Points of the Project:

The media player application is designed to be a versatile tool for users to manage and enjoy their audio and video files.
Key features include multimedia support for various formats, a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls, essential playback functionalities, and customization options.
Design patterns such as Singleton, Strategy, Decorator, and Factory are employed to enhance code organization, maintainability, and extensibility.
The Observer pattern is utilized to provide real-time notifications to users about the currently playing media item.



Project Outcomes:

Successful implementation of a media player with essential features and a well-organized codebase using design patterns.
The application provides users with a seamless and customizable media playback experience.


Challenges Faced:

The main issue was selecting a topic of my project, because the topic should fit all design patterns and be interesting too. The second problem was in emplimenting Adapter design pattern, because personally for me Adapter design pattern is the hardest one and i study and search a lot of information that helped me to understand and correctly insert it into my project.



Future Improvements:

Integration of more advanced features such as playlist management, equalizer settings, and support for additional media formats.
Enhancements to the user interface for a more visually appealing and intuitive experience.
Optimization of the media player's performance and efficiency, especially when handling large media libraries.
